Mobile + web SDKs, perf-conscious defaults (no autocapture, no replay, batched flush). Six funnel events from the audit + `app_started` / `app_returned` + uncaught exception capture. `expo-insights` removed (fragmented dashboard, OTA-reach reproduced via `app_started` properties). Vercel Speed Insights kept; covers Web Vitals at the infrastructure layer. |

## Notes for agents reading archived plans

Some past plans describe an architecture that has since been retired. Don't act on these references — they are historical context, not the current shape of the code:

- **"Classic" design mode** is gone. Many phase-3 / phase-5 plans (M1-clear-lens-design-mode, M1-desktop-shell, M3-dark-mode) still mention "Classic" screens, an `appDesignMode` setting, or "the design switch in Settings". The Settings switch was removed when dark mode shipped (PR #97); Clear Lens is now the only design. The `appDesignMode` field exists only in `migratePersistedAppState` (`src/store/appStore.ts`) so legacy persisted state is dropped on load — it is not read at runtime.
- **`src/constants/theme.ts`** is deleted. The legacy `Spacing`, `Radii`, `Typography`, and `AppColors` exports moved to `src/constants/clearLensTheme.ts` as `ClearLensSpacing`, `ClearLensRadii`, `ClearLensTypography`, and `ClearLensCompatibleTokens`. Anything in an archive plan that says `from '@/src/constants/theme'` is wrong now.
- **`useTheme().colors`** is gone. The hook returns `{ colorScheme, resolvedScheme, setColorScheme, clearLens }` — no back-compat `colors` field. Read tokens via `useClearLensTokens()` (returns `{ colors, semantic, compatible, scheme }`).
- **`useAppDesignMode`** hook is gone. Older plans reference `src/hooks/useAppDesignMode.ts` for the classic↔Clear-Lens switch. The hook and the screens it gated have been removed.

If a current task seems to depend on any of the above, escalate before implementing — it is much more likely the plan is stale than that the architecture needs to revert.
